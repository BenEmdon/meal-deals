# meal deals
## MVP Requirements
- map view where you can see current deals which are represented by a pin with a title of the deal
- when you tap the pin you are presented with a horizontal paging list  ([CenteredCollectionView](github.com/BenEmdon/CenteredCollectionView)) containing more details about the deal (when, where, what).
- The data representing the pins is accessed through firebase's realtime data store.

## Learning Required
